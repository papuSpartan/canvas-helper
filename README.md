# canvas helper
Easily find what assignments are due and when

----

As far as I know this will work with different organizations, but this should work with LETU for sure.

## Setup
For this to work you're going to need a canvas api token. You can generate one [here](https://courses.letu.edu/profile/settings) under "Approved Integrations".
Then place the token on the first line of some file(token is the default file name) that will be in the same directory/folder as where you put the shell-script
`you can easily change what file it reads from by changing $TOKENFILE`
